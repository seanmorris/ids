	<p itemprop = "description">I'm a New York based developer with a passion for the web. I currently specialize in PHP & Javascript.</p>

	<p itemprop = "description">I've been doing web development full time since I was seventeen years old. Before that I've always had some sort of hobby project online. I launched my first website in 1998: a GeoCities website for Pokemon cheats. It had a guestbook where users could share their own tricks. When I a saw it was actually getting users, I was hooked.</p>

	Since then I've gone on to work with organizations such as Martha Stewart Living, MTV and The FDA.</p>

	<!-- <p>I wrote Ids because I was bored writing the same SQL statements over and over again for different persistent objects, and over time it grew into a whole application library.</p>
